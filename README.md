# <Coding Bootcamp Study Guide>

## Description

This application is a study guide website that can be referred to and used for various topics in this course. 
My motivation for this project was my desire to do well in this program and learn some very valuable career skills so I can build a comfortable life for myself and my loved ones. I built this project because I want to have a basic understanding of the beginning aspects of software development so I'm prepared for the more complex aspects, as well as have a study guide that in and of itself allows me to practice the material. The problem that this project solves is not having an accessible and relevant study guide for this course. I learned a lot about GitHub and using terminal commands, and I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and gained a deeper understanding of how they all work.
